## Abstract:
A collaborative project to learn open-source applications and implement them. Moist problem is an interactive coding question that we have used to analyse it and use it as an aid to learn other open-source applications such as git and GitHub. We have also used other open-source applications such as nano, vim and libre office to complete this project. Collaborating together as a team using git and GitHub towards solving the above problem.

## Problem:
Moist has his childish collection of cards and its too large to keep in one disorganized pile. The problem is moist can't sort the cards because some are rather expensive and could cause damage to the cards. 
So he convinced Dr. Horrible to build a horrible robot that sorts the cards but charge his $1 whenever it has to move a trading card during the sorting process.
Moist is almost broke, but keeping his trading cards in order is the only remaining joy in his sad life. He needs to know how mych it would cost him to use the robot to sort the deck of cards.

## Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow.  Each  one  starts  with  a  line  containing  a  single  integer,N.  The nextNlines each  contain the name  of a figure skater,  in order from the top of the deck to the bottom.

## Output
For  each  test  case,  output  one  line  containing  "Case  #x:  y",  where  x  is thecase number (starting from 1) and y is the number of dollars it would cost Moist to use the robot to sort his deck of trading cards.

## Sample Input

2

Oksana Baiul
Michelle Kwan
3
Elvis Stojko
Evgeni Plushenko
Kristi Yamaguchi

## Sample Output
Case #1: 1
Case #2: 0

In Sample Case #1,
The given input is not arranged in lexographical order with a sorting change of 1. Hence the output is $1.

In Sample Case #2,
The given input is already arranged in lexographical order. So the output is $0.
